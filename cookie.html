 <h2><b>Steps</b></h2>
 <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>

        and almond extract.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Whisk flour, baking soda, and cream of tartar together in a medium bowl. Add to butter mixture;

    <br>
    <li>Place one portion of dough on a lightly floured surface and roll out to 1/4-inch thickness. 
        For each sandwich cookie, cut out two 3-inch hearts; cut out the center of one of the hearts with 
        a 1 1/2-inch cutter.
        Place cutout pieces 1 to 2 inches apart on an ungreased cookie sheet. Repeat with remaining dough.</li>

    <br>
    <li>Frost each solid 3-inch cookie with Pink Valentine Frosting and top with an open-centered cook
        ie to form a sandwich. 
        Frost the remaining small hearts and serve as separate cookies.</li>
